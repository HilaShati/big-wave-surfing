		Littoral drift. The wave propagation promotes a current flowing along the beach in a northerly direction
		, which deflects offshore near the cape, acting as a topographic barrier. This current is enhanced by the water pile-up in the cove.
		The current, flowing in the opposite direction to wave propagation, intercepts the wavefronts, 
		leading to an additional increase in the shoaling effect. The combined effect of these processes significantly increases wave height,
		which can reach much higher levels than those observed offshore. These waves break when their height is approximately equal to the local water depth.
		The results are spectacular, with giant waves breaking on the cliffs of the headland;

		In conclusion, <span>the difference in depths increases wave height,</span> the canyon increases and converges the swell, 
		and the local water current helps shape the world's biggest wave.
